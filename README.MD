E-commerce traffic data for the month of October and November 2019 were given. The data will be cleaned to generate insights on products that were purchased during that period.

### Objective

Learning Objective:
* Apply bash scripting to process data
* Apply csvkit command to process data
* Perform data cleaning in shell
* Utilize Git VCS as repository

Analysis Objective:
* To analyze top categories and products purchased in Oct-Nov 2019.


### Technologies Used

_Please ensure you have all these installed into your computer_

Packages:
* Csvkit
* Git
* Wget
* Unzip

Tools 
* Terminal: to process data
* Github: to upload project repository

### Guides to "Try it yourself" :)

1. Open terminal on your computer - make sure your pwd is at home "~" 
2. Ensure you have set up SSH Key 
3. Copy SSH link from git hub
4. Copy to terminal: git clone <SSH link> <local repository name>
5. On terminal: cd <local repository name>
6. Open data_clean.sh script
7. Change DIR to be destination directory for the project in your local computer


_Please run these test cases after you have successfully setup the project_

_Note:_
* open test.sh script
* change DIR to be project directory in your local computer (same as step 7 in prev section)
* on your terminal: bash test.sh

_Results_
1. Test case 1: validating word count for combined sample data
* Query: cat ${DIR}/data_clean.csv | wc
* Expected output:
<img src="img/case1.png" width="1000"/>

2. Test case 2: validating for purchase count based on product category & name
* Query: cat ${DIR}/data_clean.csv | grep electronics | grep smartphone| awk -F ',' '{print $5}'| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
* Expected output:
<img src="img/case2.png" width="1000"/>
